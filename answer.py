    """Distributes age probabilities.
    
    Distributes discrete age probabilities over the "more" continuous
    range from 0 to 100.
    
    Args:
        p - numpy array of probabilities (doesn't need to be normalised)
        j - numpy array of where the boundaries are. It is assumed the first value is from 0
            for example j=np.array([16,25,50]) will have four probabilities associated:
            between 0-15, 16-24, 25-49, 50+
	spread - default False. In the case where you're spreading the values over
	    p(r|0<a<10) where a is the parameter, into, e.g. p(r=4|a) we can say that
	    p(r|a=4) = p(r|0<a<10), unless we know something else.
          however...
	    if we're spreading p(0<a<10|r), then the probabilities will be divided
	    (assuming a uniform distribution) equally over the values of a in the range.
	    so p(a=4|r) = p(0<a<10|r)/10
        
    Returns:
        A numpy array of probabilities from 0 to 100.
        
    Example:
        distribute_probs(p,np.array([18,25,35,45,50,56]))
